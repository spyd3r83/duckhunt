REM DuckHunt Test Payload: Evasive Attack with Delays
REM This is a SYNTHETIC test payload for DuckHunt detection validation
REM Tests detection of attacks that add delays to evade speed-based detection

REM Test 4: Evasive attack with human-like delays
REM Attack adds random 100-200ms delays to mimic human typing speed
REM However, still has detectable patterns:
REM - Zero error rate (no corrections/backspaces)
REM - Perfect consistency in delays (no natural variation)
REM - Suspicious command patterns
REM - No mouse movement during typing

REM Expected Detection:
REM - Pattern match: WIN+R, "cmd", "curl", suspicious download
REM - Zero error rate (even with delays, no backspaces)
REM - Digraph timing anomalies (specific key-pairs have unnatural timing)
REM - No mouse correlation (bot doesn't move mouse during typing)
REM - Perfect timing consistency (human variation is statistical, not mechanical)

REM Detection Confidence: Expected 0.70-0.85
REM (Lower than fast injection, but still detectable via patterns and error rate)
